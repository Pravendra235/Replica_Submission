# Replica_Submission

Respected Sir/Madam I just had a few things to say:

1. For some reason, the animation on the LEAVE button is behaving very weirdly. 
   I designed it such that when you hover on the 'Leave' text, the text swiftly slides out of the box.
   But every time I close the file and reopen the webpage, the animation would just stop working and start behaving weirdly.
   I assign some diff values and after some time it starts working perfectly, so I close the browser and guess what it does when I reopen the file:
   Yes, it shits all over my hard work. So, I just wanted to let you know that its not like I didn't try. Hopefully its just a problem with my browser
   
2. Due to diff screen size and stuff, there could be some changes in the web page when you view it. So I humbly request you to pls view the screenshot included "onMyDevice" so    you know how it looked on my screen and get a better idea of how much it resembles the original photo.
   
            Really enjoyed doing this, by the way. Thanks a lot.
